# What's new in D2R VR

## 0.143

- **Smoother in dungeons on weaker PCs.** The torch light on the ceiling is off
  for now: finding the torches read all of the game's memory every 1.5 seconds
  and cost about a third of a CPU core while a ceiling was drawn.
- **Ceilings in act 2**: the Lut Gholein sewers (grey-beige brick) and the
  palace harem (Moorish coffers). Backgrounds done: 25 - sky over 18 open-air
  area types, a ceiling in 7 dungeon types.
- **The cathedral** keeps its flat ceiling with one dome over the altar.
- **Third person in VR**: W A S D move the hero relative to the camera.

## 0.142

- **Ceilings in the cathedral and the catacombs**, anything the game draws above
  the ceiling cut cleanly, ceiling heights from the area's floor. Settings >
  Ceiling.

## 0.141

- **Sky fixed in several areas.** Tristram, Kurast (Lower Kurast, the Bazaar,
  Upper Kurast, the Causeway), Travincal, the River of Flame, the Chaos
  Sanctuary and Nihlathak's Temple now have their sky, like the other
  open-air areas.
- **The barbarian's left hand fixed.** In first person his second weapon sits
  properly in the left hand, and he can strike with it.
- **Daggers can be thrown** - a Throw action in the mod's BodyWalk profile, plus the left-hand attack and D-pad actions.
- **"D2R Left Hand" tab** in BodyWalk's Mapping (D2R Bridge 0.23): actions for
  the left hand while it holds a weapon.
- **Ready for game updates.** Every time the game starts the mod looks for the
  game code it needs (54 places) by signature, so a game or D2RLoader update
  that moves the code does not switch the mod off. A new **Status** tab in
  D2R VR Settings shows each one - found, not found and what goes off without
  it - and a **Scan** button looks again for whatever is missing.

## 0.140

- **The author's tuned settings are the defaults**: depth from above, the body
  in F4, fog, sky, the toolbar and map in the headset, the weapons.
- **ReShade works right after installing.** The installer fixes ReShade's
  effect search path, which ReShade's own setup writes in a form it cannot read
  (no fog and no sky before).

## 0.139

- **D2R VR Settings checks the game's video settings** in its Status column:
  DLSS, Vertical Sync and TAA anti-aliasing must be off (they mix or halve the
  two eyes' frames), and a frame cap under 180 is flagged.

## 0.138 - first public release

- Four views, F1 - F4: from above in real 3D, third person, the game on your
  floor, and first person (preview - the weapons are not calibrated yet).
- Flat mode: a monitor, mouse and W A S D, no headset and no BodyWalk.
- The installer sets up ReShade, the mod, FlatVR's add-on and, if needed, a
  free BodyWalk Lite inside the game folder; an update keeps your tuned
  settings, and uninstalling removes everything the mod put in.
- D2R VR Settings: Start BodyWalk / Start FlatVR buttons, a status of the whole
  VR chain, an update check.
